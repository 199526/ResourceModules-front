CARML library is continuously improved and updated. Updates can be applied to the CI framework as well to specific modules, design changes that impact all modules can be implemented as well.

This section provides an overview on how to get your library updated.

A different scenario can apply depending on your use of the library:
- [**Scenario 1:** module library and CI environment](./Fetching%20latest%20changes%20-%20Scenario%202%20Module%20library%20and%20CI%20environment.md). In this case we refer to the update of your internalized library's repository and the related CI environment, this usually happens when adopting the [Pipeline Orchestration](./Solution%20creation.md#pipeline-orchestration) approach.
- [**Scenario 2:** module library only](./Fetching%20latest%20changes%20-%20Scenario%201%20Module%20library%20only.md). In this case we refer to the update of your copy of module templates that can be stored locally, as Template Specs or on a private Bicep Registry, as explained in [Template Orchestration](./Solution%20creation.md#template-orchestration).
